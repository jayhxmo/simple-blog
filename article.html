              <h2>Where is Simple?</h2>
              <p>
                It might surprise you that high blood pressure (hypertension) is one of the most common causes
                of death in the world. High blood pressure leads to heart disease and strokes, and it kills
                more people than all infectious diseases combined. In many countries, like the US or India,
                about 1-in-4 adults has high BP, which translates into hundreds of millions of people who are
                at risk.
              </p>
              <div class="two-column"></div>
              <p>
                Measuring outcomes is really difficult in places where doctors and nurses are already
                overworked. In countries like India and Bangladesh, a doctor or nurse frequently sees more
                than 100 patients in a single day. A typical clinic visit in the US is about 15 minutes but in
                India an average encounter is less than 5 minutes. In the US, clinicians feel burdened by data
                entry tasks — given the choice, they would maximize their time talking directly to patients,
                without their eyes glued to a computer screen. So, it’s unsurprising that busy clinicians in
                India are even less inclined to record data about patients.
              </p>
              <div class="quote">
                <p>
                  When we ask health care workers in India what they would like to see in new software, they
                  consistently tell us: "Just please don’t make my work harder."
                </p>
              </div>
              <p>
                In many places with high volume patient care there is minimal longitudinal data about
                patients. Each patient who comes into the facility is treated like a new patient, even if
                they’ve been there a hundred times before. That makes it difficult to improve the clinical
                outcomes for patients and improve the quality of the overall system. If you don’t know what a
                patient’s previous BP was, how do you know if they’re improving? If you don’t know the
                percentage trend of patients with controlled BP, how do you know if your system is improving?

              <h2>Ask for the bare minimum</h2>
              <p>
                Many medical record systems are designed by administrators or by public health officials.
                They're often disconnected from the day-to-day work of busy healthcare workers, so it seems
                like no big deal to add 'interesting' or 'useful' data entry fields. As we’ve seen with
                complex systems, if you ask for too much data, either clinicians don’t use the software at all
                or they enter low quality data: "garbage-in garbage-out."

              <h2>What we learned about this process</h2>
              <h3>Lesson 1: Just the right amount of fidelity</h3>
              <p>
                Using paper prototypes helped us to focus the users’ attention on the parts that really
                mattered — the content, not the design. The low fidelity prototypes also set the bar low, so
                nurses felt comfortable criticising the ideas and also gave them confidence to present their
                own ideas even if they couldn’t draw well.
              </p>
              <h3>Lesson 2: Choices are empowering</h3>
              <p>
                Nurses and doctors felt involved in the decision making process behind an app that they use
                every day. They expressed that they felt safe and motivated to express their thoughts. Also,
                because they could choose from many ideas, there was no pressure to be right or wrong.
              </p>
              <h3>Lesson 3: Get your users to be creative</h3>
              <p>
                When your users are busy with daily responsibilities and repetitive tasks, it is hard to
                suddenly switch context and start thinking creatively. This paper-based activity lowered the
                bar and allowed nurses and doctors to imagine scenarios “out of the device.” Pen and paper,
                and the inspiration of seeing our ideas in front of them, effectively shifted their mindset to
                creatively suggest ways our software could make their work life better.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The user would have to download the entire dataset, a large part of which was irrelevant to
                  the user. It is uncommon that a patient visits facilities in two different districts.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Syncing from the earliest record first would result in users waiting for an unknown amount
                  of time to get all the patients in their facility.
                </li>
              </ol>
